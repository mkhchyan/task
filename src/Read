# FRONTEND REACT TEST

Hi dear programmer, prepare your mind üß† and fingers üñêÔ∏è to show us your skills üöÄ in action.

As we looking forward to collaborate together, this test is here to give us a more precise appreciation of your capabilities to solve problems, think out of üì¶ and produce quality materials.

This test will span over a few days üï•, but you will not be penalized if you do not complete the entire exercise in time. The goal of this test is not only to test your coding skills, but also logic, problem resolution and time management.

The test is separate in 2 main kind of exercices:

- knowledge questions
- coding project

This file is using _Markdown language_ (\*.md) for templating üìÑ, check the [official guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [gitlab guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) to learn syntax.

## Mini Project üóÉÔ∏è

For this exercice, please refactor an HTML website into a react single page application. Estimated time is 2-3 days.

> üòÖ A son asked his father (a programmer) why the sun rises in the east, and sets in the west. His response? It works, don‚Äôt touch it!

Old website project is accessible [here](https://gitlab.uni.int/uni/others/hrs-technology). Public url is https://hrs-technology.com/.

- Use assets from old repository and improve them.
- Design can be improved depending on your skills.
- Add animations and dark mode toggle.
- Add multilanguage support for english (default) and french using browser language detection and cookie storage.

> Again, each of this steps should be in a separate commit.

In the current repository, use the `./app` folder to write the new version. It's empty, you have to install by yourself everything except `git`, `npm` and `nodejs` which are already installed in you VM.

You will check your ability to work independently üí™, to look for good solutions on the Internet üí° and to carry out quality work üìè in a limited time üï•.

> Copy-and-Paste was programmed by programmers for programmers actually. üôÑ

We will also look at `Lighthouse scores`, so improve _accessibility_, _performances_, _best pratices_ and _SEO_ ü§®.

### Requirements

You have to use `react` üòÑ!

### Recommandations

You are you free to pick the technologies and tools you want. However, here is a list of tools we are using in our company that you might want to try. Note that you will not gain any bonus by using them.

## Final thoughts

If you can record yourself solving a rubik's cube üßä in less than 2 minutes, then we might give you a bonus üòÜüòÇ #joking

### Optional open questions (not rated)

#### What do you think about the current state of frontend and Javascript?

> How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it ü§î

#### What do you think are the strengths and weakness of JS comparing to others languages?

> Don't trust JavaScript programmers. All they do is promises but they never callback. ü§≠

When exercice is complete, please notify your exercice overseer. We hope sincerely to give you a positive feedback!
